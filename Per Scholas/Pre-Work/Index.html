    <div id="divpara1"><p> I will start by welcoming everyone to my page. My name is Marcus Alan Burdine and I am glad to meet you all.
        My favorite person in the whole wide world is my wife Kryss.
        from the first time I met her it was love at first sight.
        I was so smitten with her that I put a ring on it after being together for just 2 months and it has been the best decision of my life.
        She is such a caring and loving person that I cannot help but to be a better due to her influence.
